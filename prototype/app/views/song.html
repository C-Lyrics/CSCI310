<h3>We are the Champions</h3>

[Verse 1]<br />
I've paid my dues<br />
Time after time<br />
I've done my sentence<br />
But committed no crime<br />
And bad mistakes<br />
I've made a few<br />
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face<br />
But I've come through<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
We are the <mark style="">champions</mark>, my friends<br />
And we'll keep on fighting...till the end<br />
We are the <mark style="">champions</mark>, We are the <mark style="">champions</mark><br />
No time for losers cause we are the <mark style="">champions</mark>...<br />
Of the world<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
I've taken my bows<br />
And my curtain calls<br />
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that<br />
Goes with it<br />
I thank you all<br />
But it's been no bed of roses<br />
No pleasure cruise<br />
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race<br />
And I ain't gonna lose<br />
<br />
[Chorus X2]<br />
